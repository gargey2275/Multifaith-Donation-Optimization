          Families living in these areas often have to travel long distances for medical attention, which can be costly and, at times, impossible during emergencies. 
          As a result, illnesses that are easily treatable in urban centers ‚Äî such as infections, fevers, or minor injuries ‚Äî can turn life-threatening.
